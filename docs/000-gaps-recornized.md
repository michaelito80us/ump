# Gaps recornized

**Version**: 0.1 – 2025‑05‑23

| Area still underserved                     | Why it matters                                                                                          | Lightweight, free-friendly actions you can add                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Product & UX discovery**                 | You know _what_ to build technically, but not yet _why_ every screen exists.                            | _T-0.4 Product Definition_: ① Define 2–3 personas and **jobs-to-be-done**. ② Draft end-to-end user journeys in Figma (free tier) or Excalidraw. ③ Annotate each journey step with an acceptance metric (e.g. “complete score entry in < 15 s”). |
| **Visual language & design tokens**        | Consistent look-and-feel accelerates UI work and prevents “design drift”.                               | _T-3.3 Design Tokens & Theme_: generate Tailwind config with color/spacing tokens, typography scale, dark mode. Document in Storybook next to shadcn/ui components (extends your existing T-3.1/T-3.2 work) .                                   |
| **Performance budgets & SLOs**             | Your spec sets a live-update target (< 200 ms), but no end-to-end performance envelope.                 | _T-11.4 Perf Budgets_: define Core Web Vitals thresholds, max bundle size per route (e.g. 150 kB gzip), and p95 API latency. Fail CI if regressed.                                                                                              |
| **Analytics & product telemetry**          | Without usage data it’s hard to prioritise and debug.                                                   | _T-8.3 Client Telemetry Hook_: emit anonymised events (page views, match edits) to an open-source stack (PostHog Cloud free or Umami). Wire into OpenTelemetry traces you already planned (T-13.3) to correlate backend spans.                  |
| **Security / threat modelling**            | You have RBAC guards and sandboxing, but no explicit adversarial review.                                | _T-16.4 STRIDE Workshop_: 2-hour session to list spoofing, tampering, etc., produce mitigations (e.g. rate-limit GraphQL, implement helmet). Add `npm audit --production` gate in CI.                                                           |
| **Secrets & config management**            | Solo projects often leak `.env` or rely on manual copy-paste.                                           | Add a “/infra/env/README.md” with dotenv-vault-style workflow or Vercel/K8s secrets injection. Automate `git-secrets` pre-commit hook.                                                                                                          |
| **Feature flags / remote config**          | Lets you ship narrowly scoped changes and kill-switch bugs.                                             | _T-2.7 Feature Flag Service_: simple JSON file in S3 or Supabase; client reads at startup and caches.                                                                                                                                           |
| **ADR (Architecture Decision Record) log** | Keeps rationale transparent when ChatGPT (or you) changes course later.                                 | _T-0.5 ADR Framework_: adopt `adr-tools` (bash) and commit decision templates (`/adr/0001-record-architecture-decisions.md`).                                                                                                                   |
| **Disaster recovery & backups**            | Audit logs are immutable, but DB snapshots and S3 backups aren’t defined.                               | _T-13.4 Backup Policy_: nightly pg_dump to Object Storage + restore script; monthly fire-drill.                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Legal & policy docs**                    | GDPR consent checkboxes are enforced at plugin level — good — but site-wide documents are still needed. | Generate Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Cookie banner (use free **Termly** templates). Track version in `/docs/legal/`.                                                                                                                      |
| **End-user documentation & help centre**   | Developer handbook (T-18.1) is internal; spectators/coaches need guides.                                | Use GitBook free tier; hook “Help” link in PWA. Storybook pages can double as embedded component docs.                                                                                                                                          |
| **Release & change management**            | You publish Docker images (T-14.3) but haven’t defined semantic versioning for **apps** themselves.     | Add `changesets` CLI; auto-bump and generate changelog on merge to `main`.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Cost monitoring**                        | Kubernetes manifests are provided, but no guardrail on wallet drain.                                    | Simple script in infra-scripts/ to pull monthly cost from your cloud’s billing API; post to Slack/email.                                                                                                                                        |
| **Community feedback loop** (optional)     | Early adopters catch UX gaps cheaply.                                                                   | Add a “Send Feedback” link that opens mailto or embeds a free Typeform; triage weekly.                                                                                                                                                          |
